This was the main tutorial I used. 
I used it to help with setting up the scene and renderer with CSS.
I also used it as a reference for what a good layout/structure of a larger

I also used the threejs docs extensiely https://threejs.org/docs/

I used this tutorial for writing the score and Game Over html text on the screen
